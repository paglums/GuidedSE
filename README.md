# User-guided Symbolic Execution with Visualization
A novel framework for user-guided symbolic execution with effective visualization. The visualization enables the user to control how a particular program is symbolically executed during the symbolic analysis. Based on where the symbolic executor is headed, the user can choose a search strategy, prune or focus on certain areas of code, and create models to avoid costly or impossible to cover functions. In addition to controlling the state-space explosion problem inherent in symbolic execution with the help of user-guidance, the visualization can make symbolic-execution more accessible to the general developer/tester community.
